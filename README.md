## About The Project

For this project, I utilized React to build my developer portfolio inspired by the design of Windows 95. To style the components, I wrote custom CSS classes rather than relying on a third-party library. I found the logic behind creating draggable divs to be somewhat complex, but eventually succeeded in implementing this feature without the use of any external libraries. However, to streamline my code and make it easier to read, I later incorporated the React-Use-Gesture library. Overall, this was a very enjoyable project to work on, and I hope you have fun exploring it. In the future, I hope to add additional features, such as a another game, maybe solitare, that you can play from the desktop.
