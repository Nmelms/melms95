<h1>About This Project</h1>
<p>In this project I used React to create my front-end portfolio based on the design of Windows 95. When styling the components I created custom CSS classes and didnt use a 3rd party library. I found the logic to create draggable divs pretty complex and after figuring out how to do it without a library I went ahead and installed React-Use-Gesture to make the code a little neater. This was a really fun project to create so I hope you enjoy checking it out. I hope to add more features in the future such as a minesweeper game you can play from the desktop. </p>

<h1>How to use the App</h1>
<p>If for some reason you are not familiar with Windows 95 you can click the start bar to view my resume and a few other items. Click on my Bio to learn a little more about me but be sure to open up the projects folder to take a look at what I have created.</p>
